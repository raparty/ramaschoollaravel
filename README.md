## Summary

Using School Management System, finding student information is just a few seconds away which might have cost hours, or even days, before. At the end of the semester, printing students' statements becomes just a few minutes job (the speed limitation determined by your printer), but it could be a nightmare without using School ERP System. It allows users to store almost all of their school's information electronically, including information on students, employees, properties, teaching materials etc. Most importantly, this information can be easily shared with authorized users, records can be easily searched, and reports can be easily generated.
